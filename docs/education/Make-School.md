I attended Make School, a partner school to Dominican University of California. In the summer of 2021, Make School was absorbed in Dominican, and is now known as ACS (Applied Computer Science) at Dominican University of California.

Why did I choose Make School? Given my past experiences with higher ed, I personally was drawn to Make School's accelerated and hands-on nature.

## My Experience

I absolutely loved the academics of Make School. I got to take classes with amazing instructors like Dani Roxberry, who was featured in [this CodersRank article](https://bit.ly/3cmzZGx). Dani was the lead for the track I took, Backend Web Development.
