| Graduated | B.S. in Applied Computer Science | August 2019 to July 2021 |

I attended Make School, a partner school to Dominican University of California. In the summer of 2021, Make School was absorbed in Dominican, and is now known as ACS (Applied Computer Science) at Dominican University of California.

Why did I choose Make School? Given my past experiences with higher ed, I personally was drawn to Make School's accelerated and hands-on nature.

### My Experience

I absolutely loved the academics of Make School. I got to take classes with amazing instructors like Dani Roxberry, who was featured in [this CodersRank article](https://bit.ly/3cmzZGx). Dani was the lead for the track I took, Backend Web Development.

I went to ASU as a knee jerk reaction to leaving Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Really I needed a break from school, but the classes I did take seriously had some great content.

I loved ERAU and Prescott, AZ, but had to leave due to some irreconcilable concerns with the school over how to handle my own mental health
