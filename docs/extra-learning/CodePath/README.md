# CodePath

[CodePath](https://codepath.org) provides college students with no-cost coding courses, mentorship, and career support to prepare them for careers in tech. In addition to the courses I've taken with them below, I've also been to their January 2021 Career Fair.

## Cybersecurity Course

I'm super ecstatic to report that I passed this course with honors.

This course was a lot like the cybersecurity course I took at Make School, but more offensive. We were essential graded on labs and a CTF that required us to implement exploits we'd learned about.
