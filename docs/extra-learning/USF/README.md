USF decided to offer remote certificate programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. I was most interested in their DEI in the Workplace certificate.

## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the Workplace

| Where | When | Certificate |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| Remote | Spring 2021 (7 weeks) | Pending (available June 1st?) |

Although I normally reserve this section for technical courses I do outside of school, I also decided to take USF's DEI Certificate program. I thought the course material looked important on a brochure and decided to dive into DEI as well as technical topics.

This course covered the following topics:
 - [x] Emotional Intelligence
 - [x] Stereotypes & Biases
 - [x] Understand Your Organization
 - [x] Future of Your Organization Through Diversity & Inclusion
 - [x] Recruitment & Retention
 - [x] Community Outreach
 - [x] Sustainable Business Model
