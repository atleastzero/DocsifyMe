## Education +

Check out my education in more depth [here](education/README.md).

### Make School +

| Status | What | When |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Graduated | B.S. in Applied Computer Science | August 2019 to July 2021 |

I attended Make School, a partner school to Dominican University of California. In the summer of 2021, Make School was absorbed in Dominican, and is now known as ACS (Applied Computer Science) at Dominican University of California.

Why did I choose Make School? Given my past experiences with higher ed, I personally was drawn to Make School's accelerated and hands-on nature.

### Arizona State University +

| Status | What | When |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Incomplete | B.S. in Software Engineering | January 2017 to December 2018 |

I went to ASU as a knee jerk reaction to leaving Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Really I needed a break from school, but the classes I did take seriously had some great content.

If you'd like to know more about the coursework I've personally taken at ASU, click [here](education/ASU.md).

### Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University +

| Status | What | When |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Incomplete | B.S. in Software Engineering | August 2015 to December 2016 |

I loved ERAU and Prescott, AZ, but had to leave due to some irreconcilable concerns with the school over how to handle my own mental health

If you'd like to know more about the coursework I've personally taken at ERAU, click [here](education/Embry-Riddle.md).

### Los Angeles Pierce College +

| Status | What | When |
| ------ | ---- | ---- |
| Incomplete | Associates Programs | August 2014 to May 2015 |

I took a few courses at Pierce while in high school, anticipating that I'd need to take more math courses in college.

If you'd like to know more about the coursework I've personally taken at Pierce, click [here](education/Pierce.md).

### El Camino Real Charter High School +

| Status | What | When |
| ------ | ---- | ---- |
| Complete! | High School Diploma | August 2011 to May 2015 |

Ahh high school... I'm not a big fan. If you'd like to know more about coursework I completed at El Camino, click [here](education/El-Camino).

### Extracurricular Learning +

Check out what I learn about outside of school in more depth [here](extra-learning/README.md).

#### University of South Florida +

USF decided to offer remote certificate programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. I was most interested in their DEI in the Workplace certificate.

##### Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the Workplace +

| Where | When | Certificate |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| Remote | Spring 2021 (7 weeks) | Pending (available June 1st?) |

Although I normally reserve this section for technical courses I do outside of school, I also decided to take USF's DEI Certificate program. I thought the course material looked important on a brochure and decided to dive into DEI as well as technical topics.

If you want to know more about my experience with USF's DEI Course, click [here](extra-learning/USF/DEI-in-the-workplace.md).

#### CodePath +

[CodePath](https://codepath.org) provides college students with no-cost coding courses, mentorship, and career support to prepare them for careers in tech. In addition to the courses I've taken with them below, I've also been to their January 2021 Career Fair.

##### Cybersecurity Course +

| Where | When | Certificate |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| Remote | Spring 2021 (6 weeks) | [Certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ts4VAinZkkP7vmHtV6C37Vif4QmYAtBf/view) |

I'm super ecstatic to report that I passed this course with honors.

This course was a lot like the cybersecurity course I took at Make School, but more offensive. We were essential graded on labs and a CTF that required us to implement exploits we'd learned about.
