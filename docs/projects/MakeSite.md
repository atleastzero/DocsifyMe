# MakeSite

[MakeSite](/projects/MakeSite) is a golang static site generator.

[You can check out the MakeSite repo here.](https://github.com/atleastzero/makesite)

This was a class project that I really enjoyed. Essentially, using Go and Go templates, the program converts .txt files to .html files.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Style more heavily
- [ ] Convert something harder like .jsx or .md files
