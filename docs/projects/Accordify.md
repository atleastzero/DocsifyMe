# Accordify

[Accordify](/projects/Accordify.md) is a docsify plugin that enables docsify creators to easily add accordions.

Accordions are web components that open and close when a horizontal bar is clicked. I actually use this tool on the front page of this site.

This project was just something I did because I used them on this site and wanted others to be able to easily add accordions as well.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add more/better stylesheets.
- [ ] Find a way to add link support (maybe a link button next to the plus).
