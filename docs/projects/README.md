## Accordify

[Accordify](/projects/Accordify.md) is a docsify plugin that enables docsify creators to easily add accordions.

You can check out the Accordify GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/atleastzero/docsify-accordify).

It's also on npm [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docsify-accordify).

Accordions are web components that open and close when a horizontal bar is clicked. I actually use this tool on the front page of this site.

This project was just something I did because I used them on this site and wanted others to be able to easily add accordions as well.

## MakeSite

[MakeSite](/projects/MakeSite) is a golang static site generator.

You can check out the MakeSite GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/atleastzero/makesite).

This was a class project that I really enjoyed. Essentially, using Go and Go templates, the program converts .txt files to .html files.
