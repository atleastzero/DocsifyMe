# FakeLang

[FakeLang](/projects/FakeLang.md) is an npm package that allows for fake language generation and translation.

You can check out the FakeLang GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/atleastzero/FakeLang).

It's also on npm [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fakelang).

Basically, I wanted to be able to obscure text into realistic looking languages that may look like sci-fi or fantasy languages, or even just vaguely like a real language.

The purpose of this is for use in web app ideas I have for TTRPGs.
