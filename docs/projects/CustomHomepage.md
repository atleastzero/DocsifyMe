# CustomHomepage

[CustomHomepage](/projects/CustomHomepage.md) is a React project I built for a Make School intensive that features drag and drop widgets.

I wanted to get used to my newfound (at the time) React skills to create something with drag and drop capability. So I spent much of a week learning to use react-dnd, a drag and drop library for React. Then, added some simple widgets, and wah lah!
